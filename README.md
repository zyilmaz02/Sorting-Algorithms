# Sorting-Algorithms
this is a implementation of various sorting algorithms.
it will read integers from txt file and sorth them using 5 different sorting algorithm.
the main idea for this project to see how much time does it requare for each sorting algorithm to sort large data 
i will recommend to run each algorithm separately when the number of data (integers) is really hight
